How We Create Your Custom Made Ear Plugs

1. Our experienced technicians will meticulously examine your ear canals to ensure precise measurements.
2. Accurate moulds or impressions are then taken of each ear canal to create a custom fit.
3. Using these moulds, we craft a pair of hearing protectors from durable UV-treated material or soft medical-grade silicone.
4. For the hard version, a hypoallergenic coating is applied for added comfort.
5. Inside each custom moulded earplug, our patented acoustic attenuation ceramic filters are expertly secured.
6. Approximately 4 to 5 weeks after the mould is taken, you'll receive your custom-fit earplugs.
7. Additionally, we provide you with the original moulds in case of loss or if you need a replacement.

Typically, a set of moulded earplugs lasts for at least 5 years depending on usage and only requires replacement as your skull shape changes over time. We guarantee each set for 2 years
