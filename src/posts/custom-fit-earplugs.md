Auritech Custom Made earplugs are renowned for their exceptional comfort and remarkable effectiveness. When seeking the ultimate hearing protection for your activity, look no further.

## How we create your custom made earplugs:

* Our experienced technicians will meticulously examine your ear canals to ensure precise measurements.
* Accurate moulds or impressions are then taken of each ear canal to create a custom fit.
* We make ear protectors from strong UV-treated material or soft medical-grade silicone using these moulds.
* For the hard version, a hypoallergenic coating is applied for added comfort.
* Inside each custom moulded earplug, our patented acoustic attenuation ceramic filters are expertly secured.
* Approximately 4 to 5 weeks after the mould is taken, you'll receive your custom-fit earplugs.
* Additionally, we provide you with the original moulds in case of loss or if you need a replacement.

Usually, a pair of moulded earplugs can be used for at least 5 years. You may need to replace them as your head shape changes. We guarantee each set for 2 years
