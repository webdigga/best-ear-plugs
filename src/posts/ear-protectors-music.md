## Why Choose Auritech Hearing Protectors for Music?

Unamplified instruments like drums and brass can produce noise levels up to 100dB, while amplified music at festivals, concerts, or clubs can reach a staggering 130dB. Permanent hearing damage can occur from just 85dB, making it essential to use hearing protection whether you're a musician on stage or an enthusiastic spectator.

## What Sets Auritech Concert Earplugs Apart?

Developed over two decades by leading audiology experts, Auritech MUSIC Hearing Protectors outperform traditional foam, wax, or silicone earplugs. Our precision-tuned, patented ceramic sound filters provide maximum protection against dangerous noise levels from loud music. While filtration reduces volume, it maintains the clarity of sound, allowing you to enjoy music without compromise. Plus, our earplugs are comfortable and suitable for all ages. Trust Auritech for unparalleled hearing protection without sacrificing music quality.
