For over two decades, Auritech WORK Hearing Protectors have been meticulously crafted by top audiology experts, surpassing traditional foam, wax, or silicone earplugs in quality and effectiveness.

Our precision-tuned, patented ceramic sound filters offer unmatched protection from hazardous noise levels commonly found in work or factory environments exceeding 80dB. Despite this robust protection, our earplugs allow for clear listening to surrounding conversations without causing a muffled effect.
